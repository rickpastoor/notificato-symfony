> *Italian:* **notificato** Ã¨: participio passato *English:* **notified**

## What is Notificato?
Notificato makes you send push messages from PHP projects, this repository is a Symfony2 & Symfony3 bundle to easily integrate into Symfony. Want to know more about Notificato? Please check out the [Notificate repository](https://github.com/mac-cain13/notificato) for more information.

## Installation

### 1. Add Composer dependency
Installation with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is recommended. Run the require command to add Notificato to your project:

`composer require wrep/notificato-symfony`

### 2. Include the bundle in your Kernel
Add `NotificatoBundle` to `app/AppKernel.php`:

```php
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        ...
        new Wrep\Bundle\NotificatoBundle\NotificatoBundle(),
        ...
    );
}
```

### 3. Configuration of the default certificate
Add the following configuration options to your `app/config.yml`:

```yml
notificato:
    apns:
        certificate:
            pem: /path/to/pem/certificate.pem       # Required if you want to use a default certificate
            passphrase: the-passphrase-of-the-pem   # Required if you want to use a default certificate
            validate: true                          # Optional, default true, set to false if certificate validation fails
            environment: sandbox                    # Optional, autodetect by default, set to production/sandbox if certificate validation fails
```

The given certificate will be used as default certificate. It's completely optional to set a default certificate, but recommended if you only push to one App.

## Getting started
Once installed you can start using Notificato quite easily from any `ContainerAware`-environment. Lets say you want to send a pushmessage from a controller:

```php
class PushController extends Controller
{
    public function indexAction()
    {
        // First we get a Notificato instance
        $notificato = $this->get('notificato');

        // Now let us get a fresh message from Notificato
        //  This message will be send to device with pushtoken 'fffff...'
        //  it will automaticly be associated with the default certificate
        $message = $notificato->createMessage('ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff');

        // Let's set App icon badge with this push to 1
        $message->setBadge(1);

        // The message is ready, let's send it!
        //  Be aware that this method is blocking and on failure Notificato will retry a few times
        $messageEnvelope = $notificato->send($message);

        // The returned envelope contains usefull information about how many retries where needed and if sending succeeded
        echo $messageEnvelope->getFinalStatusDescription();

        // Of course you should return a nice Response here!
    }
}
```

Use `$this->get('notificato');` to get a Notificato object that is already set up with the default certificate from the config. From there everything is the same as using the normal Notificato library, so check out the [docs](https://github.com/mac-cain13/notificato/blob/master/doc/Readme.md) and [API description](http://mac-cain13.github.io/notificato/master/) over there for more tips and tricks.

Note that there are more services available to get deeper into the Notificare structure, take a look at the services.xml if you're interested.
